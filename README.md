# DevCoin
DevCoin is a blockchain-based reward system that incentivizes real open source contributions. By verifying commits, pull requests, and issue resolutions on GitHub, DevCoin mints tokens to fairly reward developers for their workâ€”bridging the gap between coding and crypto to create a transparent, community-driven economy for open source collaboration
